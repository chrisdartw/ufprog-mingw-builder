# ufprog-mingw-builder

This repository hosts a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and release the **ufprog** (from [hackpascal/ufprog](https://github.com/hackpascal/ufprog)) utility for Windows (64-bit) using the **MinGW** toolchain via **MSYS2**.

## ðŸš€ Usage

This workflow is configured to run manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in this repository.

2. Select the **"Build and Release ufprog (MinGW)"** workflow.

3. Click the **"Run workflow"** button on the right.

4. The workflow will:

   * Clone the latest source code from `hackpascal/ufprog`.

   * Compile the executables and dynamic libraries (DLLs) using MinGW.

   * Collect all necessary build artifacts and runtime DLLs into a portable folder.

   * Compress the folder into a single `.zip` file.

   * Create or update a GitHub Release using the commit date as the version tag (`build-YYYY-MM-DD`).

The final compressed artifact will be attached to the new release.
